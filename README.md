# Hi, I'm Anita 👋

I'm a Java backend developer who enjoys building practical, maintainable systems — and writing about the messy parts most tutorials skip. I work a lot with Spring Boot, and I care about code that's not just working, but also explainable.

## 🛠️ What I usually work with
Most of my day-to-day involves:
- Building and maintaining Spring Boot microservices with IntelliJ IDEA
- Working with MongoDB and PostgreSQL
- Writing unit tests and integration tests using Cucumber
- Working with Docker and GitLab CI for builds and pipelines, often on OpenShift
- Communicating with teammates and business representatives
- Documenting processes and decisions

## ✍️ What I write about
Most of my posts live on [Medium](https://medium.com/@anitalakhadze). I like answering questions I’ve asked myself — and probably ones you've asked too. 

- What is software entropy?
- Should I squash my Git commits?
- Why is OpenFeign so much nicer than WebClient?
- How to write a proper custom validator in Spring Boot?

## ⚡️ Fun fact
I’ve argued more about naming things than about actual business logic 🤭
