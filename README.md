# Hi, I'm Anita 👋

I'm a Java backend developer who enjoys building practical, maintainable systems — and writing about the messy parts most tutorials skip. I work a lot with Spring Boot, and I care about code that's not just working, but also explainable.

## 🛠️ What I usually work with
Most of my day-to-day involves:
- Building and maintaining Spring Boot microservices with IntelliJ IDEA
- Working with MongoDB and PostgreSQL
- Writing tests - from unit tests to integration tests using Cucumber
- Docker and GitLab CI for builds and pipelines, often on OpenShift or Kubernetes
- Communicating with teammates and business representatives to clarify requirements and expectations
- Documenting processes and decisions so that everyone has a clear understanding without having to guess

## ✍️ I like to write about things I've struggled with
I like answering questions I’ve asked myself — and probably ones you've asked too.

Most of my posts live on [Medium](https://medium.com/@anitalakhadze), where I share real-world problems and how I worked through them. 

If you've ever googled something like:
- What is software entropy?
- Should I squash my Git commits?
- Is `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)` not always the best idea?
- Why is OpenFeign so much nicer than WebClient?
- How to write a proper custom validator in Spring Boot?

... then you'll probably find something useful there.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on
- Improving observability across several Spring Boot services  
- Improving internal docs for a team with mixed experience  
- A blog series that follows a developer’s thought process — one question at a time

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
- Exploring tools and technologies that could help me improve code quality
- How to design project structure so that it stays understandable as the codebase grows
- Write blog posts that help others follow the thought process, not just the code.

## 💬 Ask me about
- Spring Boot internals and when to skip the “defaults”  
- Validation strategies (simple, custom, weird edge cases)  
- Sentry, Flyway, OpenFeign — and integrating them

## ⚡️Differ Fun fact
I’ve argued more about naming things than about actual business logic 🤭
