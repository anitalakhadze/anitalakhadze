# Hi, I'm Anita 👋

I'm a Java backend developer who enjoys building practical, maintainable systems — and writing about the messy parts most tutorials skip. I work a lot with Spring Boot, and I care about code that's not just working, but also explainable.

## 🛠️ What I usually work with
Most of my day-to-day involves:
- Building and maintaining Spring Boot microservices with IntelliJ IDEA
- Working with MongoDB and PostgreSQL
- Writing tests - from unit tests to integration tests using Cucumber
- Docker and GitLab CI for builds and pipelines, often on OpenShift or Kubernetes
- Communicating with teammates and business representatives to clarify requirements and expectations
- Documenting processes and decisions so that everyone has a clear understanding without having to guess

## ✍️ I like to write about things I've struggled with
I like answering questions I’ve asked myself — and probably ones you've asked too.

Most of my posts live on [Medium](https://medium.com/@anitalakhadze), where I share real-world problems and how I worked through them. 

If you've ever googled something like:
- What is software entropy?
- Should I squash my Git commits?
- Why is OpenFeign so much nicer than WebClient?
- How🤸🏻‍♀️to write a proper custom validator in Spring Boot?

... then you'll probably find something useful there.

## ⚡️ Fun fact
I’ve argued more about naming things than about actual business logic 🤭
